## About

I am earning a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering at University of Rome Tor Vergata.

I work as Web Developer at Syrus Industry.

I think computer science could improve everyone's life, both in everyday's little things and in the scientific progress of humanity. 

I consider crucial quality, simplicity and clarity of each product, even in the smallest detail.
